# Unity-Squash3D
My very first 3D game developed using Unity - simulates Squash practice. Have fun!

Developed using Unity v2018.3.12

Simulates a very simple Squash/Tennis style interface, with mouse control to move the racquet. A random ball shooter spawns balls every 2.5 seconds and you try hitting the ball with the racquet. If it goes back towards the front wall, that's a nice shot and worth 5 points! If you miss 10 balls, you lose.

If you have any suggestions, feedback or helpful advice - I'm all ears! Email me at nidhisalian08@gmail.com

To report bugs - Open an issue, I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can!
