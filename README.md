# Unity-Squash3D
My very first 3D game developed using Unity - simulates Squash practice. Have fun!

Developed using Unity v2018.3.12

To open this project in your Unity Editor, unzip the Assets folder and select the root folder to import into unity as a new project. It should create the libraries for you but that take a while. Also, I've noticed some downward compatability issues with Unity before so try and make sure your version matches mine, or is even more recent. I've checked recently with v2019.1.8 and it worked just fine. 

Simulates a very simple Squash/Tennis style interface, with mouse control to move the racquet. A random ball shooter spawns balls every 2.5 seconds and you try hitting the ball with the racquet. If it goes back towards the front wall, that's a nice shot and worth 5 points! If you miss 10 balls, you lose.

If you have any suggestions, feedback or helpful advice - I'm all ears! Email me at nidhisalian08@gmail.com
